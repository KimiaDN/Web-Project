# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a website for systemizing doctor appointments for different specialties. This website will introduce a variety of doctors in different specialties, simplify the process of setting appointments for patients, and help them find a suitable doctor based on site reviews.

# Description
- The website consists of two parts: Frontend and backend
- Front end is designed with HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend is designed with PHP and MySQL database

# Implementation
The website has two types of users: patients and doctors. Doctors will register themselves on the website and set their working hours. Patients can find doctors based on their specialty or city, and either call them to get an appointment or reserve it directly from the website. They can also leave a review on the doctorâ€™s page after their appointment. The reservation process is simple, and patients can easily edit or delete their reservations before the appointment.
